<p>Unluckily Git-crypt has a bug where encrypted files get corrupted when unlocked with a wrong key. Now that the file has been changed you have local changes.<br>If you try to revert the wrong encrypted files you will get a filter-error because the key is also needed to reverse the correct file.<br>To solve this problem you have to set the correct key in the preferences and force the key into the .git directory with the <code>git-crypt force key</code> feature.<br>After that you can revert the process because now the right key is used for the filter.</p>
